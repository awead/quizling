        Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its
        clear syntax and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first
        released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its notable
        use of significant whitespace.

        Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural,
        object-oriented, and functional programming. It features a dynamic type
        system and automatic memory management. Python has a comprehensive
        standard library, often described as having a "batteries included"
        philosophy.

        The language is widely used in web development, data science, artificial
        intelligence, scientific computing, and automation. Popular frameworks
        include Django and Flask for web development, NumPy and Pandas for data
        analysis, and TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning.

        Python uses an interpreter which allows for quick development and testing
        of code. The Python Package Index (PyPI) hosts over 400,000 third-party
        packages that extend Python's functionality for various use cases.
